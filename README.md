## A weather planner to help facilitate travelers and other curious persons on current weather conditions.  

We created a Weather Dashboard to provide weather updates. HTML, CSS, weather API as well as Jquery was used to create this dashboard. Jquery library was used to dynamically update the weather foorecast. In this dashboard, the user will have the option of entering a city which will give dynamically updated weather forecast, after which the city entered will be saved to local storage.
